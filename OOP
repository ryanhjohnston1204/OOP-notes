//These are notes for object oriented programming in C++
//All of these notes are a quick overview of everything
//==============================================================================
//Classes and objects (attributes)
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class myClass{//class is called myClass
public://access specifier is public (not hidden from the user)
  int myNum;//attribute myNum is of variable int
  string myString;//attribute myString is of variable string
};
//he class keyword is used to create a class called MyClass.
//The public keyword is an access specifier, which specifies that members
//(attributes and methods)
//of the class are accessible from outside the class.
//You will learn more about access specifiers later.
//Inside the class, there is an integer variable myNum and a string variable
//myString.
//When variables are declared within a class, they are called attributes.
//At last, end the class definition with a semicolon ;.
//==============================================================================
//create an object
int main()
{
	myClass myObj; //Create an object of myClass

	//Access attributes and set values
	myObj.myNum = 15;
	myObj.myString = "some text";

	//Print attribute values
	cout << myObj.myNum << endl
		<< myObj.myString << endl;
}

//MULTIPLE OBJECTS==============================================================
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

//Create a car class with some attributes
class Car
{
public:
	string brand;
	string model;
	int year;
};

//main program
int main()
{
	//Create object for Car class
	Car myObj;
	myObj.brand = "Honda";
	myObj.model = "Accord";
	myObj.year = 2014;

	//Create another object of Car class
	Car myObj2;
	myObj2.brand = "Camaro";
	myObj2.model = "black";
	myObj2.year = 1999;

	//Create ANOTHER object of Car class
	Car myObj3;
	myObj3.brand = "Ford";
	myObj3.model = "white";
	myObj3.model = 2010;

	//Print attribute values
	cout << "First car is " << myObj.brand << endl;
}

//CLASS METHODS=================================================================
//Class methods are functions that belong to the class
//You can define functions that belong to a class inside or outside
//EXAMPLE

//INSIDE------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class myClass//class identified as myClass
{
public://access specifier is public
	void myMethod()//void function myMethod defined inside of myClass class
	{
		cout << "hello world" << endl;//outputs "hello world"
	}
};

int main()//main program
{
	myClass myObj;//object of myClass has been created
	myObj.myMethod();//myMethod void function has been called through object myObj

	return 0;
}

//OUTSIDE-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class myClass
{
public:
	void myMethod();//void function myMethod declared but NOT defined
};


void myClass::myMethod()//void function myMethod defined outside of class
{
	cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
}

int main()
{
	myClass myObj;//Object created of myClass
	myObj.myMethod();//function (method) myMethod is called

}

//PARAMETERS--------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class myClass
{
public:
	void myMethod();//void function myMethod declared but NOT defined
};


void myClass::myMethod()//void function myMethod defined outside of class
{
	cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
}

int main()
{
	myClass myObj;//Object created of myClass
	myObj.myMethod();//function (method) myMethod is called

}

//CONSTRUCTORS==================================================================
//A constructor in C++ is a special method that is automatically called when an
//object of a class is created.

//Constructors
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class myClass
{
public:
	myClass()
	{
		cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
	}
};

int main()
{
	myClass object;
	return 0;
}

//CONSTRUCTOR PARAMETERS--------------------------------------------------------
//Constructor Parameters
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Car
{
public:
	string brand;
	string model;
	int year;
	Car(string x, string y, int z)
	{
		brand = x;
		model = y;
		year = z;
	}
};

int main()
{
	Car carObj1("Honda", "Accord", 2014);
	Car carObj2("Ford", "F150", 2020);

	cout << carObj1.brand << " is also an " << carObj1.model << carObj1.year
  << endl;
	cout << "My " << carObj2.brand << " is ALSO an " << carObj2.model <<
  carObj2.year << endl;


	return 0;
}

//ACESS SPECIFIERS==============================================================
//Access Specifiers
//public and private
//Public keyword is an access specifier
//They define how the members (attributes & methods) of a class
//can be accessed
//There are three types
//public - members are accessible from outside the class
//private - members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class
//protected - members cannot be accessed from outside the class,
//however, they can be accessed in inheritee classes. You will learn
//more about Inheritance later

class Class
{
public://Public access specifier
	int x;//Public attribute
private://Private access specifier
	int y;//Private attribute
};

int main()
{
	Class obj;
	obj.x = 5;//Allowed (public)
	obj.y = 6;//Not allowed (private)
	return 0;
}

//ENCAPSULATION=================================================================
/*
The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden
fromusers. To achieve this, you must declare class variables/attributes as
private
(cannot be accessed from outside the class). If you want others to read or
modify the value
of a private member, you can provide public *get* and *set* methods
*/
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Employee
{
private:
	//Private attribute
	int salary;
public:
	// Setter
	void setSalary(int s)
	{
		salary = s;
	}
	// Getter
	int getSalary()
	{
		return salary;
	}
};

int main()
{
	Employee obj;
	obj.setSalary(100);
	cout << obj.getSalary();
	return 0;
}

//INHERITANCE===================================================================
//Inheritance
/*
In C++, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods
from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept"
into two categories

derived class (child) - the class that inherits form another class
base class (parent) - the class being inherited from

To inherit from a class, use the : symbol.

In the example below, the Car class (child) inherits the attributes
and methods from the Vehicle class (parent):

*/
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


// Base class
class Vehicle
{
public:
	string brand = "Ford";
	void honk()
	{
		cout << "honk" << endl;
	}
};

//Derived class
class Car : public Vehicle
{
public:
	string model = "Mustang";
};

int main()
{
	Car myCar;
	myCar.honk();
	cout << myCar.brand + " " + myCar.model;
	return 0;
}

//When to use "Inheritance"?
/*
It is useful for code reusability: reuse attributes and methods
of an existing class when you create a new class
*/

//MULTILEVEL INHERITANCE--------------------------------------------------------
/*
A class can also be derived from one class,
which is already derived from another class
*/
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base class (parent)
class parent
{
public:
	void myFunction()
	{
		cout << "Some content in parent class";
	}
};

// Derived class (child)
class child : public parent
{

};

// Derived class (grandchild)
class grandChild : public child
{

};

int main()
{
	grandChild object;
	object.myFunction();
	return 0;
}

//MULTIPLE INHERITANCE----------------------------------------------------------
//Multiple Inheritance
/*
A class can also be derived from more than one base class,
using a comma-separated list:
*/
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base class
class parent
{
public:
	void function()
	{
		cout << "Some content in parent class";
	}
};

// Another base class
class parentTwo
{
public:
	void functionTwo()
	{
		cout << "Some OTHER content in second parent class";
	}
};

class child : public parent, public parentTwo
{
	// No code goes here
};

int main()
{
	child object;
	object.function();
	object.functionTwo();
	return 0;
}

//INHERITANCE ACCESS============================================================
/*
You learned from the Access Specifiers chapter that there
are three specifiers available in C++. Until now, we have
only used public (members of a class accessible from outside
the class) and private (members can only be accessed from
within the class). The third specifier, protected, is
similar to private, but it can also be accessed
in the inherited class:
*/
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


// Base class
class Employee {
protected: // Protected access specifier
    int salary;
};

// Derived class
class Programmer : public Employee {
public:
    int bonus;
    void setSalary(int s) {
        salary = s;
    }
    int getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }
};

int main() {
    Programmer myObj;
    myObj.setSalary(50000);
    myObj.bonus = 15000;
    cout << "Salary: " << myObj.getSalary() << "\n";
    cout << "Bonus: " << myObj.bonus << "\n";
    return 0;
}

//POLYMORPHISM==================================================================
/*
Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that
are related to each other by inheritance.

Like we specified in the previous chapter;
Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class.
Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks.
This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
For example, think of a base class called Animal that has a method called
animalSound().
Derived classes of Animals could be Pigs, Cats, Dogs, Birds -
And they also have their own implementation of an animal sound
(the pig oinks, and the cat meows, etc.):


*/
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


// Base class
class Animal {
public:
    void animalSound() {
        cout << "The animal makes a sound \n";
    }
};

// Derived class
class Pig : public Animal {
public:
    void animalSound() {
        cout << "The pig says: wee wee \n";
    }
};

// Derived class
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void animalSound() {
        cout << "The dog says: bow wow \n";
    }
};

//Now we can create Pig and Dog objects and override the
//animalSound() method:
// Base class
class Animal {
public:
    void animalSound() {
        cout << "The animal makes a sound \n";
    }
};

// Derived class
class Pig : public Animal {
public:
    void animalSound() {
        cout << "The pig says: wee wee \n";
    }
};

// Derived class
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void animalSound() {
        cout << "The dog says: bow wow \n";
    }
};

int main() {
    Animal myAnimal;
    Pig myPig;
    Dog myDog;

    myAnimal.animalSound();
    myPig.animalSound();
    myDog.animalSound();
    return 0;
}

//Why and When to use "Inheritance" and "Polymorphism"?
/*
It is useful for code reusability: reuse attributes and methods of
an exiting class when you create a new class.
*/

//C++ FILES=====================================================================
/*
The fstream library allows us to work with files
To use the fstream library, include both the standard
<iostream> AND the <fstream> header file:

*/

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

//Remember ofstream and ifstream

//Example
int main()
{
	// Create and open a text file
	ofstream myFile("filename.txt");

	// Write to the file
	myFile << "Files can be tricky, but it fun enough!";

	//Close the file
	myFile.close();
}

//READ A FILE-------------------------------------------------------------------

//Create a text string, which is used to output the text file
string myText;

//Read from the text file
ifstream myReadFile("filename.txt");

// Use a while loop together with the getline() function to
//read the file line by line
while (getline(myReadFile, myText))
{
	// Output the text from the file
	cout << myText;
}

// Close the file
myReadFile.close();
